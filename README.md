This plugin adds some styling to the admin area of wondercms.
This is mostly my personal preference, hosted on github for ease of installation.

Things that change:
- Adds a small header to the settings panel
- Input fields look like the default bootstrap ones
- No smallcaps font but default
- Fixes the font after the link symbol
- Makes alerts float at the top of the screen
- Makes the save dialog less visual obstructive

Default look:
